Welcome to Technical Writing Hub's documentation!
=================================================


Introduction
------------


Technical writing is the act of explaining technical concepts in simple, precise, and concise way. Technical writers help make complex topics accessible by breaking them down into steps using clear language. In the past few years, there has been an explosion of interest in technical communication as businesses realize that they need clear instructions and explanations for their products. 

If you'd like to get started in this rapidly growing field, you’ll need a lot of skills, including technical, writing, and design skills. It can be very satisfying to help people understand and use new technologies as a technical writer. Technical writing is not just limited to software and hardware documentation but for the purpose of this blog, we’ll only focus on the tech industry.


Among the many types of documentation technical writers create are:

API documentation
-----------------

APIs (Application Programming Interface) are used to expose the functionality of a software program and make it available to other applications. An API documentation is the document that explains how to use the APIs exposed by a software program or library. The purpose of an API documentation is to explain how the APIs work, what inputs they accept, what kind of outputs they produce, what conditions need to be fulfilled for using them and so on.


How-to guides
-------------
How-to guides are step-by-step instructions for a process or task. They are written in the second person (you) and use imperative mood, which means the subject (you) is being told what to do. Often, these guides provide context for why you should be doing the steps provided and may even include an example of what results they can achieve.



User manuals
------------
A user manual is a document that explains how to use a product. User manuals may be included with physical products, or available online. They may take the form of printed books or digital documents or videos. User manuals typically include instructions on how to set up and use the product, troubleshooting advice and other information related to its use.

Technical reports
-----------------

Technical reports are written for an audience with a technical background.
They’re meant to be used by other professionals, not the general public.
This means you can get away with using jargon, but you should still make it accessible for people who do not have a lot of experience with your subject matter.
Reports should be easy to read, but not dumbed down or full of jargon that only applies to your own industry (unless you’re writing something like a company newsletter). 

Manuals
--------
A manual is written to help people use a particular product. For example, the manual for your car will contain information about how to use it and how to fix it if it breaks.
The manual can be online or in print (a physical book).
There is a lot of variety in technical writing jobs.


Conclusion
-----------
Technical writing is a very rewarding career, with its own unique set of challenges. If you have good communication skills and enjoy working in teams, then technical writing may be right for you. It also allows you to work remotely and offers flexible hours so that you can travel or spend time with your family without sacrificing income. As an added bonus, technical writers often make more money than their peers who do not specialize in this type of writing because the demand for qualified people remains high even during economic downturns. Technical writers are needed in every industry from healthcare to education-the possibilities are endless!
