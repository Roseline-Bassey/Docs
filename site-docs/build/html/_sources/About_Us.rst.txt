========

Hi there!

I am Roseline Bassey, an English major, and a technical writer who is passionate about making technology more accessible and easy to understand.

I'm also interested in writing about life at work from the point of view of a technical writer.

During my free time, I write on a variety of technical writing topics.

Technical Writing Hub is where I discuss topics relating to technical writing and open-source.

This blog aims to create a space where readers can find resources related to technical writing, from beginner tips to advanced strategies.

This blog is updated regularly so be sure to check back often.

Contact me if you have any questions or comments.
